A test question with some Java code on it from the JCoCo project. I will ask you to identify parts of a Java program including the following:
    A subclass
    A superclass
    An inner class
    A type cast
    An instance variable
    A method
    A return type
    A generic class
    Object instantiation
    A constructor
    An anonymous class
    An example of auto-boxing or unboxing.
