Friday test question will be over chapter five, specifically high-order functions: mainly map, filter, and foldr.

You should know how to write and use one of those three functions.

They're in the book and the implementation is there.

Filter: 211
Foldr/reduce: 210
Map: 209

------

Write and use filter, foldr, and map. Study them.

It shouldn't be too hard. But do some of the examples he did on his book. Plus make sure you understand the definition of each of those functions.
And filter as well.
foldr is somewhat like an accumulator patter where you have the initial value then whatever the result computed from the function passed as an argument added* to the intial value. Lets add values from 1 to 10 in python and sml to demonstrate.
sum = 0 then followed by for i in range(1, 11) : sum = sum+i
foldr op+ 0 [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
